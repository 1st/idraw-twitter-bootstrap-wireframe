iDraw wireframe for Twitter Bootstrap
=================================

Hello.

I bought the iDraw vector image editing program for Mac OS. I build web design based on Twitter Bootstrap. To simplify my work I created 12 columns grid to show how to place elements on web page.

In the iDraw file you will find browser frame for all resolutions that Twitter Bootstrap support (1200px, 980px, 768px, tablet and mobile devices).

And finally, for some situations you will need to use 16 columns grid. You can find this wireframe too. All placed in different layers in the single document.

I recommend you to use 12 columns grid where it is possible. Because in most cases you build design as: sidebar "span3" + center column "span9". After all, in the center column you have 12 columns, and you can place in this column 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 columns. In case with 16 columns grid you can use 1, 2, 4 or 8 columns. You need select what you need to do. But in most cases 12 columns grid is more flexible to do what you need.

Feel free to place comments and send you improvements to this project.

Best regards,
